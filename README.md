# Discord4F

**Attention**! For the base of this project, I took my previous one, that is, this one [\*Click\*](https://github.com/shizamuru-dev/MatrixGPT) what does their similarity in update time and functionality mean 💫
And I almost forgot! At the moment, the bot is designed to work **ONLY** in private messages
A little bit about functionality:
 - [x] 🤖 Support for private messages with the user
 - [x] 📝 Short-term memory ( 20 messages )
 - [x] 🧹 Forced memory cleanup
 - [x] 💸 Free api for working with chatgpt
 - [x] 🔁 It is possible to change the provider by the user
 - [ ] 🖲️Using PostgreSQL as storage
 - [ ] There could be your suggestion here...
